# Survivals_MACS30112 Final Project

## The Effect of Google Customer Ratings on Dallas Hotels' Revenue


### Project Goals
The Survivals group's project aims to investigate the reputational and signaling effects of customer reviews on online platforms, specifically focusing on their impact on Dallas hotel revenues. Our group aim to explore whether customer ratings can affect a hotel's revenues. We are also interested in how do online customer ratings influence Texas hotel revenues through signal or reputation channels, and how big are their magnitudes?
